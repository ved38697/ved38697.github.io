		<h3><a href="#area2">Motto</a></h3> 
			<div id="area2">
			<br>
			Everyday, the sisters strive to live by the motto, <i>Esse Quam Videri</i>,
			which means <b>to be rather than to seem to be.</b> This motto means to live
			your life as a genuine woman and always be as transparent as possible. It urges
			members to not live under a facade and to actually live by their words and to
			always be accepting and caring towards others. The purpose of this sorority is
			to accept women of all backgrounds, and Delta Phi Epsilon was the first non-sectarian
			social sorority.
